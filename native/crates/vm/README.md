# nupp-vm

The Nupp runtime of the runtime plan (`~/projects/nupp-plans/todo/nupp-runtime.md`,
contracts in `nupp-runtime-contracts.md`), started 2026-10-11 as the real P3
build after the prototype in `bench/runtime-experiment` had answered its design
questions. No JIT here: that is P5. What is here is the object model, the heap
and collector, the interpreter with one-stack frames and parking, the library,
the image loader and verifier, and the host services on the parking surface.

## Layout

| module | what it owns |
| --- | --- |
| `value` | the NaN-boxed word: tags for nil, false, true, function handle (image id and index), object |
| `heap` | the fixed 32-byte header, inline payloads, size-classed chunks, large objects, the incremental tri-colour collector with stress, interleaved, quarantine and oracle modes, shapes, the weak intern table |
| `interp` | tasks, frames inline on one stack of words, the opcode set and dispatch loop, calls and returns, varargs in the frame, host calls that park |
| `builtins` | the library the compiler's modules use (strings with Lua patterns, tables, math, iteration, errors) |
| `verify` | operand classes, branch and callee checks, fact re-derivation, def/use and liveness |
| `image` | the loader for the emitter's text image |
| `host` | a pool of host threads serving file, sleep, process and directory requests as plain data |
| `emit/emitmod.lua` | the module-graph emitter from the checker's tree, run with `nupp run` from `emit/` |

## Decisions the layout fixes

- **Header.** `kind, color, class, flags, epoch, size, aux, aux_ptr, aux_len`:
  32 bytes, payload inline after it. Compiled code will read a string's
  bytes, a record's slots or a table's array part from `aux_ptr`/`aux_len`
  with no call. `aux` holds a record's shape and a closure's function id.
- **Allocation.** Thirty size classes from 32 bytes to 32 KiB, 256 KiB chunks
  aligned to themselves so an address finds its chunk by masking; larger
  objects on their own. `is_live_slot` is a chunk-set lookup and a slot
  boundary check, which the root walk uses to accept a register word.
- **Growable payloads** (a table's parts, storage, byte buffers, a record's
  ordered children) are Rust vectors inline in the object; the header
  re-mirrors their pointer after a change.
- **Records** are slots inline, then the ordered children a record type
  declares (`{cst.Node | lexer.Token}` inside the record), then an overflow
  map a structural shape may grow (an optional field of the declared type
  written after a closed constructor). Nominal shapes refuse unknown fields
  on write (contracts 2.5); an untyped read of an absent field is nil on
  any record, because the compiler's own `x.trivia ~= nil` tests on `any`
  need it (2.4 amended).
- **Strings** are interned when at most 40 bytes (1.3); a longer string or a
  slice used as a table key is looked up and stored by content through the
  intern table. Equality past the word compare is by content for string-like
  objects.
- **Varargs** stay in the frame: a vararg function's surplus arguments lie
  just below its header, their count in header word 3, and a trailing `...`
  in a call copies them straight into the callee. No object is allocated.
- **Roots** are every task's value windows down the caller chain, each
  frame's closure and vararg words, results, constant pools, handle scopes
  and registered handles; the heap walks shape names and methods itself.
- **Snapshots are prepared for, not built.** `Heap::each_child` is the one
  walk the marker and the oracle share and the serialiser will share; the
  roots are enumerable through one trait; task stacks are plain words. The
  serialiser and the restore path are P5 work.

## Running

```sh
cargo build -p nupp-vm --release
cd native/crates/vm/emit && ../../../../bin/nupp run emitmod.lua ../../../.. nupp.bench.parsebench > ../parser.image
cd .. && ../../../build/rust/target/release/nupp-vm run parser.image nupp.bench.parsebench parse @../../../src/nupp/compiler/syntax/parser.nupp --setup setup --repeat 5
```

`GC_STRESS=1`, `GC_INTERLEAVE=1`, `GC_ORACLE=1` and `GC_QUARANTINE=1` select
the collector's verification modes. `TRACE_CALLS=1` prints every call.

## Where it stands (2026-10-11)

The compiler's lexer and parser run unmodified on it, as module graphs
emitted from the checked tree, and agree with LuaJIT node for node:

| source | nodes | Rust loop | threaded core | LuaJIT interpreter | LuaJIT JIT |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| lexer.nupp (41 KB), lex only | 4,903 tokens | 8.0 ms | 5.9 ms | 2.7 ms | 0.43 ms |
| lexer.nupp, parse | 8,523 | 15.6 ms | 10.2 ms | 5.9 ms | 4.3 ms |
| cst.nupp (94 KB), parse | 12,197 | 23.7 ms | 15.4 ms | 8.7 ms | 3.9 ms |
| parser.nupp (156 KB), parse | 40,179 | 67 ms | 44.6 ms | 26.8 ms | 16.9 ms |

Under stress with the oracle the lexer-source parse runs 19,000-odd full
cycles and the parser-source parse survives interleaved marking with the
oracle and quarantine, on both dispatch loops.

**Dispatch.** The Rust `match` loop spent 60% of the parse in dispatch at
2.4 ns per opcode (27.9M opcodes for parser.nupp). The tail-call-threaded
core in `csrc/dispatch.c` (contracts 5.2) handles the hot opcodes and the
call and return path in C, with specialised helpers for field reads,
indexed stores, builtin calls and allocation and a generic one-opcode
fallback into the Rust interpreter for the rest (0.7% of opcodes). It
takes the interpreter from 2.6x to 1.7x LuaJIT's interpreter. The profile
on it is flat across handlers, led by `Move` (18% of opcodes), cell and
upvalue reads (17%) and the box and unbox traffic between the value and
typed register files; the next lever is the opcode count, which is the
emitter's: move elimination, hoisting a captured local's cell read, and
keeping typed locals in one register file.

Bugs the parser found: a dynamic call to a closure copied `sig.len()`
registers from the caller's window, so a parameter the call did not supply
held a stale word instead of nil, and the parser took a type path on it; a
`return f()` returned eight registers rather than what `f` returned; image
string constants with bytes outside ASCII were written raw; a field named
`method` collided with the image's method entries.
